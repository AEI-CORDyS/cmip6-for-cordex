  doi: [pers_comm, K. Winderlich, DWD]
  metric:
    name: SCQS 
    long_name: Synoptic Circulations Quality Score 
    units: 
    variables: z500
    comment: Domain is CORDEX-EU. Data z500 is converted to daily anomalies and normalized by daily standard deviation.
             Data are than attributed to previously obtained Synoptic Circulation (SP) classes. 
             Number of Synoptic Circulation classes: 43 (derived on daily ERA-Interim data, 1979-2018).
             For each model 7 variables are computed from the attributed daily data:              
             1) HIST - frequency of each SP-class (year through)
             2) HIST_JFD - frequency of each SP-class (winter)
             3) HIST_MAM - frequency of each SP-class (spring)
             4) HIST_JJA - frequency of each SP-class (summer)
             5) HIST_SON - frequency of each SP-class (autumn)
             6) SEQUENCE – matrix of frequencies for the subsequent occurrence of the pair of two synoptic patterns SPi?SPj.
             7) PERSISTENCE – matrix of frequency for persistence of each SP-class for 1,2,3,.. N days in a row. 
             The SCQS is computed as the mean of 7 individual Quality Scores computed on each of these variables.              
     best: 1
     worst: 0
  type: performance
  spatial_scope: Regional
  temporal_scope: Daily, Seasonal
  plausible_values: the higher the better, SCQS between reference reanalysis (ERA-Interim) and an alternative reanalysis (NCAR-NCEP1) is in the table for comparison.
