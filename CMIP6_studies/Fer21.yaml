      Score summarizing the ability of the models to represent the transition
      probabilities between weather types.
      Values correspond to ERA-Interim as reference (blue bullets in Figure 6,

    comment: >
      Bra21 explores also weather type reproduction (frequency of occurrence
      rather than transition probability) and provides data for a much larger
      amount of models.
      Weather types in Fer21 are centered over the British Isles, while Bra21
      considers weather types for each grid point in Europe.
