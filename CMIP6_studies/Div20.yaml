      Scoring of models on performance for blocking frequency. Blocking frequency bias has been calculated by the method of
      Davini and D'Andrea (2020). The individual CMIP6 models have then been clustered into categories based on their
      RMSE, bias and correlation compared to multiple reanalysis JRA-55, NCEP-NCAR, ERA-40, ERA-Interim. Data for individual
      CMIP6 models and clustering of errors into categories are provided by the author for Europe.

      Based on the method of qualitative scoring
      in McSweeney et al. (2015) and adapted for CMIP6. The scoring has been
      changed from the traffic light coding to numbers for EURO-CORDEX.

      Values
      0 - Low errors over both local and remote regions.
          Captures key characteristics of the criteria spatially or temporarily,
      1 - Some substantial errors present but not widespread or not present in
          the local region of interest. Location of larger remote errors are not
          known to have a downstream impact in the local region of interest.
          Captures key characteristics of the criteria spatially or temporarily,
      2 - Substantial errors in remote regions where downstream effects could
          be expected to impact on the reliability of regional information
          and/or present in the local region of interest,
      3 - Large widespread errors to the extent that the model is unable to
          represent the present-day climatology in a useful way and future
          projections by the model cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way.

        Large widespread errors (value 3) lead to consider the model unplausible.
        The data has been taken from the first realisation or lowest number realisation where this was not available.
