      Scoring of models on performance for the North Atlantic storm track.
      Based on RMSE of the zonal mean track profile between 25-80N compared
      to ERA5 and qualitative assessment of the trimodal structure of the storm
      track. Storm track calculated by method in Priestly et al. (2020), data
      and scores provided by author. Based on the method of qualitative scoring
      in McSweeney et al. (2015) and adapted for CMIP6. The scoring has been
      changed from the traffic light coding to numbers for EURO-CORDEX.

      Values
      0 - Low errors over both local and remote regions.
          Captures key characteristics of the criteria spatially or temporarily,
      1 - Some substantial errors present but not widespread or not present in
          the local region of interest. Location of larger remote errors are not
          known to have a downstream impact in the local region of interest.
          Captures key characteristics of the criteria spatially or temporarily,
      2 - Substantial errors in remote regions where downstream effects could
          be expected to impact on the reliability of regional information
          and/or present in the local region of interest,
      3 - Large widespread errors to the extent that the model is unable to
          represent the present-day climatology in a useful way and future
          projections by the model cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way.

        Large widespread errors (value 3) lead to consider the model unplausible.
        The data has been taken from the first realisation.
