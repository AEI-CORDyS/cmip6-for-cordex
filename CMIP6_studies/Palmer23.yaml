      Qualitative large scale circulation patter score based on overall pattern, bias and RMSE.
      Based on 20 year climatology comparison with ERA5 1995-2014.
      criteria is an updated on the work by McSweeney et al. 2015 but for CMIP6
      Based on the method of qualitative scoring in McSweeney et al. (2015) and
      adapted for CMIP6. The scoring has been changed from the traffic light
      coding in the paper to numbers here
      1 (white)  - Satisfactory. It gathers two categories: Low errors over both local and remote regions and Some substantial errors present but not widespread or not present in the local region of interest. 
                   Location of larger remote errors are not known to have a downstream impact in the local region of interest. Captures key characteristics of the criteria spatially or temporarily.
      2 (orange) - Unsatisfactory, substantial errors in remote regions where downstream effects could be expected to impact on the reliability of regional information and/or present in the local region of interest.
      3 (red)    - Inadequate. Large widespread errors to the extent that the model is unable to represent the present-day climatology in a useful way and future projections by the model cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way.
        (grey)   - Data/ analysis not available for a given model. This category ha sno number here

      In agreement with the authors we decided to eliminate only models with the Red flag (Inadequate, value = 3)
