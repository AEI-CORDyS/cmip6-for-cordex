      TCR is calculated from the CO2-only simulation, where the atmospheric CO2
      concentration increases at a rate of 1% per year, centered on the time of
      doubling of the atmospheric CO2, which occurs during simulation year 70
      (we use the mean of the years 61 to 80).

      The values of the GCM TCR  can be found in Suppl. Mat Table S1. Some model
      TCR are missing. This study is based on multi-member for each model, not
      on only one member.

      This is not the period for the metric values (these are model years at
      the time of doubling CO2), but the one used in the observational constraint.

      This is a 90% likely range (5-95%) for the TCR.
