      From Figure 5. Model family tree for all 33 CMIP6 models, similar to
      Knutti et al. (2013). Models branching further to the left are more
      dependent, and models branching further to the right are more independent.
      The analysis is based on global, horizontally resolved tasCLIM and
      pslCLIM in the period from 1980 to 2014. Labels with the same color
      indicate models with obvious dependencies, such as shared components
      or the same origin, whereas models with no clear dependencies are
      labeled in black.

      Strangely, ACCESS-CM2 is in the same family as UKESM and HadGEM3, but
      not ACCESS-ESM1-5.

      Evaluation of the model using global criteria (past trends + spatial pattern)
      and independence criteria. Model with performance scores below 0.006 are
      considered as irrealistic. This study is based on multi-member for each model,
      not on only one member.

      Here only the performance criteria and not the combined criteria that takes
      also into account the independence.
